Welcome to the Language Transfer app! Thanks for your interest in contributing :)

## How to build and run the app

Follow the instructions on the [React Native website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) on setting up a fresh environment, up to the "Creating a new application" section.

Then, clone and install dependencies for the repository.

1. `git clone https://github.com/language-transfer/lt-app.git`
2. `cd lt-app`
3. `npm install`

When you're ready to run the app, run:

    npx react-native run-android

To build a production-ready release, add on the `--variant=release` flag:

    npx react-native run-android --variant=release

## Issues & Pull Requests

For now, go ahead and open issues/PRs willy-nilly. We'll get some guidelines in here if we need to standardize or manage project work. It would be wise to check with the core project maintainers before starting work on a PR, just to make sure you don't duplicate work or go too far in the wrong direction.
